1. We have modified the quotes.xml file to have a quote with the xml tag "keywords" and each quote now has a unique identifier, specified by <id></id>. This makes it much easier to check if the correct quotes are returned. Now from here we will need to write a function called getIdOfLastQuote(), so that new quotes can have unique id's by simply incrementing them by one. The quotes will have 
id's ordered from least to greatest, starting at the top of the xml file. We have written a test called getLastIdTest() which fails because the id being returned is 0 rather than the expected, 10.
2. Added a searchKeyWords() test that tests our searchKeyWords(String keyword) test, located in Engine.java. We've added a quote at the bottom of the quotes.xml file with certain keywords such as health and fitness. The test calls the function expecting any quotes that have the keyword "health". As of now the test fails because our searchKeywords(String keyword) function searches using the quotelist.search(String keyword, int mode) function and passes in Nixon for keyword and 2 for mode. The
quotelist.search() function is searching for quotes with the word Nixon in the author section and/or quotes text. Right now the test fails because there is an index outofbounds error since there are no quotes with "health" as the author and/or in the quotes text. Therefore the test is attempting to index an empty list of quotelist.
