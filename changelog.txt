- Added a new class called engine.java where we will run the main functions of the program
 + asking user to enter a number for their desired use case
 + get user input for the search keywords
 + kept the xml parser to parse the xml file and put in all the quotes into the quoteList variable

- changed the array "quoteArray" in quoteList.java to be public instead of private so we could use it in the engine.java file

- the quoteserver.java file was deleted since it was of no use and brought compiling errors since it was missing the servlet library

Changed what was being printed to the user from "Enter keyword" to "Enter search query".
Also added a README file for instructions on how to compile and run locally.

HW2:

changed quoteArray in quotelist back to private and changed code in engine.java to use the methods from quoteList.java to retrieve information about the quote list
