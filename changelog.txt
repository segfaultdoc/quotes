- Added a new class called engine.java where we will run the main functions of the program
 + asking user to enter a number for their desired use case
 + get user input for the search keywords
 + kept the xml parser to parse the xml file and put in all the quotes into the quoteList variable

- changed the array "quoteArray" in quoteList.java to be public instead of private so we could use it in the engine.java file

- the quoteserver.java file was deleted since it was of no use and brought compiling errors since it was missing the servlet library

Changed what was being printed to the user from "Enter keyword" to "Enter search query".
Also added a README file for instructions on how to compile and run locally.

HW2:

- changed quoteArray in quotelist back to private and changed code in engine.java to use the methods from quoteList.java to retrieve information about the quote list

- added the addQuote() function in engine.java. this is the function that gets the new quote from the user and then updates the programs quote list and updates the xml file

- made a change to the functions searchAuthor() , searchQuote() , and searchBoth() in engine.java
  + the functions were printing out the wrong results do to printing out the wrong quote list within the for loop
  + they now print out the correct results

- Important Note!
	After a quote is added, during each subsequent run of the program, the 
	same added quote is displayed as the "Random Quote of the day"; and 
	this is only on the first iteration of each run. However, when another
	quote is added, the samething happens but not for the newly added 
	quote. Instead an arbitrary quote is displayed during each first 
	iteration of the running program, each time the displayed quote is the
	same as the last.

- Data Integrity
	Added a class called black list which has a hardcoded arraylist of 
	innappropriate words that are checked when new quotes and authors are
	added. Created a class called Profanity in which we will further scale
	this functionality out in the coming weeks..
